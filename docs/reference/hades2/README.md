# Hades II reference data

This directory stores versioned research/reference snapshots extracted from an installed Hades II build. It is documentation data only: production code, packaging, tests, and runtime behavior must not depend on it.

Current snapshot:
- Hades II 1.139672
- Steam build 24556151
- Path: `1.139672-24556151/`

The snapshot records identifiers and relationships from the game's data tables rather than copying Lua source. It intentionally preserves normal entries, debug/internal entries, inheritance-only stubs, aliases, and names that may not be safe trainer targets.

Snapshot contents include:
- full inventories for consumables, loot, traits, resources, stores, rooms, encounters, units, weapons, projectiles, progression, requirements, and UI data;
- `trait_sources.csv` and `room_links.csv` relationship indexes;
- curated `catalog_legality.csv`, `well_shop.csv`, `reroll_ledger.csv`, and `special_interactions.csv` research ledgers;
- `manifest.json` with source build and row counts.

## Usage

Use these files as the first lookup point when investigating whether an Hades II identifier exists, what table owns it, where it is referenced, or whether previous research classified it as direct, special, alias, internal, or excluded.

Do not infer runtime safety from existence in a generated table. The generated tables are intentionally exhaustive and include stubs/debug/internal data. Prefer the curated ledgers when a trainer-facing legality decision has already been recorded.

## Refresh policy

When the supported Hades II build changes, create a new sibling version directory from the installed target build rather than overwriting this snapshot. Review the diff and carry forward curated classifications only after checking changed game semantics.

The extraction procedure is research tooling, not part of MacGamingTrainer production code. Keep one-off/local extraction scripts outside the repository unless a future task establishes a real product or CI requirement for them.
